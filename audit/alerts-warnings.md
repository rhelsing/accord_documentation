# Alerts/Warnings

![](/assets/alerts and warnings.jpg)

It is important to understand the different alerts and warnings that are generated by the data:

**1095-C Critical Alerts** – represent those elements within the client data that could generate problems or penalties on a form or when the data is sent electronically to the IRS. These Alerts must be resolved as best as we can before submission.

**1095-C Warning Alerts** – represent system warnings and are more informational. These may not need resolution, but rather a check to make sure there are not systematic issues in the data. Some of these may get removed as the Critical Alerts are resolved.  
  
**Impact of Delays**

Delays in the above steps can cause a lack of attention to critical errors and penalty alerts that need corrected prior to form print and data send to IRS. If need be, we should file extensions for clients that are behind in their audit timeline.
