The following are Accord team value statements. These should each individuals decision making. When deciding between several paths forward, analyze if the certain paths can be eliminated due to conflicts with these statements. This is a living document. We do not want to have multiple, underlying, hidden and conflicting value statements that will hinder our success and cohesion. If you disagree with any of the following statements, let's have a discussion. We are seeking team alignment so let's get on the same page instead of building our culture on erroding soil.

We are learners.
