The following are Accord team value statements. These should each individuals decision making. When deciding between several paths forward, analyze if the certain paths can be eliminated due to conflicts with these statements. This is a living document. We do not want to have multiple, underlying, hidden and conflicting value statements that will hinder our success and cohesion. If you disagree with any of the following statements, let's have a discussion. We are seeking team alignment so let's get on the same page instead of building our culture on eroding soil.

##We are learners.
##Buckle down and own it:

nothing is below your pay grade.. doers #culture

Don't just do it yourself and don't just mindlessly delegate.. spend time to teach and do gritty stuff yourself sometimes

##async (asynchronous)

We will try not to do things that take others time if they do not have to. If you have a question to ask and it is not mission critical, do not interupt someone for that answer. Send them a note and move on to something else, or answer notes sent to you while you wait on a response. We do not want to interupt or halt someones productivity just so we can get our answer now. Of course, there are exceptions to this value. This point is primarily about not distracting others, so they can focus on thier work. **The primary reason for this interupting a programmer is the best way to destroy an hours worth of information in 10 seconds**:

##visible, collaborative, accessable

We do not want to use apps or methods that cannot be accessed, modified, or commented on by all at any time. Managing any sort of process should not be done on a Excel document or an application that cannot be freely accessed by all. This is important to get right so that we can be asyncronous. The best tools right now for this are trello, the main accord application itself, and our team chat application.
