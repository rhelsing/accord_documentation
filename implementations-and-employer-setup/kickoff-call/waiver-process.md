# Waiver Process

1. Are they able to provide waivers on the medical files?
2. If yes, are there defaults run in the system for those that do not touch enrollment? \(will those employees come over as a waiver on a medical file if they never touch the system?\) 
3. If no to \#1 or yes to \#1 and no to \#2, then do they approve Accord to generate waivers for full-time employees?
4. If yes to 3, then we need to know about waiting periods for waivers and if it varies across class \(will we need a custom field\)
