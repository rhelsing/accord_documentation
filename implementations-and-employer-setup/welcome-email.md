#### Email Template -

Hi \[Client Name\],

The on-boarding procedures looks like this:

1. You will need to go onto our site,[https://accord-aca.com/signup](https://accord-aca.com/signup) and complete the online implementation.

2. I know you are busy so if at all possible in the next 1-2 weeks \(please let me know if we need to push that back\) we will need to schedule a kick-off call to go over any questions you may have and to discuss the next stage of the implementation process.

3. Preparation of Data Test Files.

4. Data call to answer any concerns or questions regarding file process.

The kick off call will confirm all the set up and begin the conversation about your data and what is needed to accurately provide the services for ACA reporting.

Please let me know if you have any questions and once you have completed the online implementation.

Again, thank you for engaging Accord and I look forward to working with you!
