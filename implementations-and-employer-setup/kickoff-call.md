# Kickoff Call

##### 4** Weeks Out Client Should have Kick-Off Call**

Trello checklist and details.. possibly sub articles for each detail  
FAQ needs to be updated.  
Every person interacting with client must be perceived as ACA expert. Instruction on how to fake that confidence, until it is real.

The Account Manager will set-up and lead the kick-off call. The main purpose of the initial call is to confirm setup and prepare client expectations for data delivery; please include Data Team member on this call. Please review the supporting documents. Below are the key setup items:

**Introductions of both Accord and Client teams**

**Review and confirm online implementation information**

**Verify Waiver Process** – please see **Waiver Process** directions

**Confirm All Data Sources** – Payroll, Medical, Cobra, Time and Attendance, etc.

_**Gathering Historical Payroll Data \(Full Service\)**– To accurately track employee eligibility on your go-live date, 14 months of historical payroll data is required when we initialize the system._

_**Gathering Historical Medical Data \(Full or Forms Only\)**– Medical data for both employees and dependents \(if self-insured\) must be submitted from the beginning of the current calendar year._

**Reviewing Attached File Specs and Sample Layouts –**Attached are Layouts 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 along with samples of each file type. 1.1 is the spec to be shared with your payroll vendor when discussing historical payroll data. 1.2 is Employee Medical and 1.3 is Dependent Medical. On the implementation call, we will discuss these in detail and answer all questions that your IT/data/HR contact has on these.

**Confirmation of Measurement Periods and Employer Setup**– We will confirm the information provided in your online implementation, along with additional details on your measurement periods, lowest cost monthly premiums, additional FEIN’s/ALE Member \(if applicable\), and waiting periods for medical.

**Establish Data Delivery Protocol**

– We will need to determine how the client and vendors to client will get data to Accord.

Accord Dashboard is easiest – we can set up SFTP or Secure E-mail \(least\)
