# Client / Broker Training

##### 2 Weeks Out - It is very important at this point to provide overview and training to both client and broker \(if they want\).

* Data Team provides overview of key concepts of system
* Data Team demonstrates the main areas that client will need be aware of
* Show key functionality of the forms generation and data auditing capabilities
* Set expectations of how client will need to engage with us both ongoing and at year end.

**Impact of Delays**

Client will call and need a complete training at the busiest time of the year.
