# Client Online Setup

##### **5 Weeks Out Client Should be Setup through Online Implementation**

Every new customer must start with the online implementation. This tells us we have a real customer that is ready to implement with us.

Please go to site: [https://accord-aca.com/signup](https://accord-aca.com/signup). Test it yourself to understand the questions that are part of the process.

Key functions of the online signup process are:

1.Employer sets up their user name and password, as well as agrees to “terms of use”

2.Employer, by answering the questions in the setup wizard, creates the system setup once approved by implementation manager.

3.Basic setup questions include:

     a.Name of company and Federal Employer ID – \(FEIN\) – additional ALE members

     b.Medical plan start dates, waiting periods and funding \(self-insured or fully insured\)

     c.Measurement period information for variable hour employees

     d.Payroll information

     e.Lowest cost monthly premium

     f.Services they are requesting of Accord – Full Service Tracking, Forms Only, etc.

_User is not required to complete every field to sign up. Part of kick off call will confirm any gaps._

**Impact of Delays**

Implementation cannot begin until this step is complete
