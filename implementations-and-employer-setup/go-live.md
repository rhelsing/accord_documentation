# Go Live

##### 0 Weeks Out - 

As long as our process has been followed closely, going “Live” is a non-event. It means their data is live and ongoing data files now need to come regularly and their billing cycle for ongoing services will begin. Client should be sent the following e-mail announcing their status.

Hi \[Client Name\],

Your organization is now live on the Accord ACA system! Thank you for your assistance in getting set up. Here are some quick tips to get you started using the system:

1. To login to your dashboard, go to: [https://accord-aca.com](https://accord-aca.com/) and click the Login button in the top right; enter your e-mail and password that you set up, or use the auto reset if you need to

2. Review the dashboard once logged in.

3. Certain parts of the system are more relevant to your year-end filing. Specifically the "Forms" Section is where you will go to review the 1094- and 1095-C before they are delivered to employees and transmitted to the IRS.

4. You can chat with a member of the Accord Team using the chat button in the bottom right corner of any screen you are logged into on the dashboard.

Most importantly know that we are here to assist so if you have questions about the system or the service please let me or a member of the Accord Team know.

Thank you for engaging Accord and I look forward to working with you!
