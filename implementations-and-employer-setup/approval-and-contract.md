# Approval & Contract

Assuming that new customer has completed the online setup process, Account Manager will approve customer in the Accord system, by going to Employer&gt;&gt;Sign Ups&gt;&gt;Approve. If customer has yet to complete online setup, then return to previous task.

**Setup Kick-Off Call**

Via e-mail setup kick-off call with client and broker – part of e-mail should include all appropriate attachments for data specification.

**Contract**

Once client is approved, make sure you initiate contract completion process by contacting the operations group to generate the proper contract – Forms Only, Full Service, etc.  
**Invoice**

Work with Operations team to generate initial set-up or ongoing invoice.

**Impact of Delays**

Timeline for implementation and data cleansing processes become problematic the longer we wait to complete this step and get customer contracted.  Please note that delay in collection of initial invoice will require prioritization of customer implementation
