Once a client is ready to move forward with Accord there is an implementation and employer setup. The following steps will guide you through client implementation.

* Client Integration - Source of Client is Needed - Onboarding Process / Portal / Proposal

* Account Manager Reach Out - Initial Setup for Client

* Client Sets-Up Account Online \(Done before Kick-Off Call or with Account Manager on Call\)

  * Information Needed

    * Service Type \(Full Service, Forms Only, Forms Express\)

    * Legal Employer Name

    * Company EIN - If there are ALE's, all are needed

    * Main Contact Information - Name, Email, and Phone

    * Benefit Contact Information - Name, Email, and Phone

    * Company Address - If there are different addresses for ALE's, all are needed

    * Total Lives and Benefit Eligible Lives

    * Affordability / Safe Harbor Method Used - If this is not known the client will need to verify with their broker

    * Lowest Cost Monthly Premium - If this is not known client will need to verify with their broker

    * Self-Funded or Fully-Insured

    * Plan Year Start

    * Measurement Period - default or own

    * Certificate of Eligibility

  * Implementation Call with Account Manager

    * Key Steps for Call

      * Full Accord Team Introductions

      * Full Client Team Introductions

      * Review and Confirm Online Implementation Information from Online

      * Verify the Waiver Process - 1\) Are they able to provide waivers on the medical files? 2\) If yes, are there defaults run in the system for those that do not touch enrollment? \(will those employees come over as a wiaver on a medical file if they never touch the system?\) 3\) If no to \#1 or yes to \#1 and no to \#2, then do they approve Accord to generate waivers for full-time employees? 4\) If yes to 3, then we need to know about waiting periods for waivers and if it varies across class \(will we need a custom field\)

      * Go over Data needed depending on client type

        * If they are Full Service - historical data is needed for payroll and medical \(depending on where the medical files are coming from - could be various vendors\)

          * Payroll needs to be historical for 15 months, i.e. if they go live on June 1, 2017 then the files need to go back to April 1, 2016

          * Medical files need to come over from the start of the reporting year from all vendors that are providing medical files

        * If they are Forms only \(no tracking done\) - demographic files are needed as a base

          * Demographic files to show all employees for the current year are needed back up agains medical files

          * Medical Files need to come over from all vendors the client is or has used within the reporting year. All medical data should be submitted by November of the reporting year to properly run reports before reporting deadlines

        * Determine if Cobra is needed and where it will come from - Needed from clients that are self-insured

      * Determine the best way to have client deliver the first round of data

        * Accord Dashboard Drop - Preferred Method and Easiest for Accord and Client

        * SFTP - Needs to be setup by Ryan, Will or Steve before this can be utilized

        * Secure Email - Accord Account Manager needs to send secure email to client to start the secure thread

      *
