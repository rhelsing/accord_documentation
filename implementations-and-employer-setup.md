5. Implementation Call with Account Manager
   1. Key Steps for Call
      1. Full Introductions of the Accord Team
      2. Full Introductions of the Clients Team
      3. Review and Confirm Online Implementation Information from Online
      4. Verify the Waiver process – 1\) Are they able to provide waivers on the med files? 2\) If yes, are there defaults run in the system for those that do not touch enrollment? \(will those employees come over as a waiver on a med file if they never touch the system?\) 3\) If no to \#1 or yes to \#1 and no to \#2, then do they approve Accord to generate waivers for full-time employees? 4\) If yes to 3, then we need to know about waiting periods for waivers and if it varies across class \(will we need a custom field\)
      5. Go over Data needed depending on client type
         1. If they are Full Service we will need historical pay data and med files depending on where they have kept their med files
            1. Payroll needs to be historical for 15 months, i.e. if they go live on June 1, 2017 then the files need to go back to April 1, 2016
            2. Medical files need to come over from the start of the reporting year from all vendors that are providing medical files

            ii. If they are Forms only \(no tracking done\) demographic files are needed as a base
            1. Demographic files to show all employees for the current year are needed to back up against medical file
            2. Medical files need to come over from all vendors that gathered data and can be submitted in November of the reporting year.

            iii. Determine if Cobra is needed and Where it will come from

         vi. Determine the best way that the client can deliver the first round of data

         1. Accord Dashboard Drop – Preferred Method and easiest for Accord and Client

         2. SFTP - The SFTP will need to be set up by Ryan, Will or Steve first

         1. Secure Email – This will be done by Accord Account Manager sending a secure email
