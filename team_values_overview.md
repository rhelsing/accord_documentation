# Team Values

The following are Accord team value statements. These statements should guide each individual's decision making process when combined with quarterly roles and stated company initiatives. We have assigned you a quarterly role. If you are uncertain about your role or of the company initiatives related to your role, please ask! If you disagree with these statements, let's have a discussion. We are seeking team alignment, so let's make sure we are on - and stay on - the same page.

## Building and maintaining trust

In any business relationship \(or personal for that matter\), trust is the single most important "glue". Trust is earned by making good on your commitments, or having an understandable and credible reason why you fell short. When we say we will do something, we will do our best to do it. Additionally, we will speak up quickly if we don't think we can make good on our goals.

## We are a culture of doers, learners, teachers.

Don't just take on all the work yourself and don't just mindlessly delegate either. Spend time to teach. Spend time doing the gritty stuff yourself. Try not to think of any task, no matter how menial, as below your pay grade. Spend time really understanding the problem before delegating. This will take some adjustment but we want each individual to be their own manager, use their own judgment when finding this balance.

## Weekly goal tracking & focused, agile, time management

We are process and output oriented \(complete weekly goal report / have broad goal for month / do not disturb section\). Don't take on more than you can chew and end up not completing any of the tasks you set for yourself, and don't set your bar low so that you can always achieve your goals. One of our primary roles is to **learn how to consistently find our work threshold, so that we can accurately set our own achievable goals**, and have those goals at the same time be substantial, without burning out. Try to set measurable goals for yourself.

## Team cohesion, unified goal, direct communication

Let's discuss things we disagree on until we agree or compromise. Let those be declared and explicit instead of implied. We will always attempt to reach decisions in a collaborative manner; however senior leadership will need to make decisions periodically when there are multiple dug in opinions. Then, we will all row the same way.

## Visible, collaborative, accessible

We want to use applications or internal/external processes that can be accessed, modified, or commented on by all relevant staff. Managing processes should **never** be done on local Excel files or costly membership-based applications when free and accessable alternatives exist. This is important to get right so that we can be asynchronous \(see the relevant section\) and maintain a low barrier to entry when adding members to a team or process. The best tools right now for this are Trello, the main accord application itself, our team chat application \(Mattermost\), and Github.

## Async \(Asynchronous\)

Asynchronous means multiple people can work at the same time. We will try not to do things that consume others' time if we do not have to. If you have a question to ask, and it is not mission critical, do not interrupt someone for the answer. Send them a note and move on to something else, or answer notes sent to you while you wait on a response. We do not want to interrupt or halt someone else's productivity just so we can get our answer immediately. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. This point is primarily about not distracting others, so they can focus on their work. Relevant example: [http://twitpic.com/dj27dh](http://twitpic.com/dj27dh)

Having a headphone policy will help with this too. When someone has their headphones on, leave them alone unless "the building is on fire". If you need to grind, put your headphones on.

## Agile

In certain cases, rigorous planning before action can hurt you more than help. When building a new feature or experimental strategy, instead of over planning, build a quick and naive solution based on your best theory for action at the time and set a short deadline for yourself to try it out. You will learn vastly more about what really needs to be done in attempting a solution rather than planning to tackle it. Get the manual solution working before we try to make an automated one. **Please note that this approach does not apply to all areas. It works very well for finding unknown unknowns, for features and experimental strategies, but not for well understood problems. Know when to apply this strategy and when not to. Some related terms are: scientific, sprints, adaptive, minimum viable product, minimum viable solution, being scrappy, doing more with less, self-imposed creative restraints.**

## Documentation

We want our processes to be approachable for new employees, We also want our practices documented so that team members are not spending unnecessary amounts of time repeating the same answers and teaching the same concepts \(See the asynchronous section\). If you find yourself asking the same question or explaining the same concept multiple times, it is a good candidate to be added in the relevant section of the process documentation or to the knowledge base.

## Development issue and feature log

Is this a big problem or a little problem? At any given time, there will be 3-5 years of improvements that need to be made to the system. We should only add something to this list if it comes up consistently and is truly a problem. A true problem can be defined as tremendous impediment to usability of the product, not a "would be nice" enhancement; we should prioritize our list of issues with this concept in mind. We manage these on Github with the issue tracker.
