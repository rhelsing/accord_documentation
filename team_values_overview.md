#Team Values

The following are Accord team value statements. These statements should guide each individuals decision making process when combined with quarterly roles and company initiatives. If you are unsure of your role or the company initiative related to your role, ask! When deciding between several paths forward, analyze if certain paths can be eliminated due to conflicts with these statements. This is a living document. We are trying to avoid having multiple, underlying, hidden and conflicting value statements that will hinder our success and cohesion. If you disagree with any of the following statements, let's have a discussion. We are seeking team alignment, so let's get on the same page instead of building our culture on eroding soil.

##We are a culture of doers, learners, teachers.

Don't just take on all the work yourself and don't just mindlessly delegate either. Spend time to teach. Spend time doing the gritty stuff yourself. Try not to think of any task, no matter how menial, as below your pay grade. Spend time really understanding the problem before delegating. This will take some adjustment but we want each individual to be their own manager, use their own judgment when finding this balance.

##Weekly goal tracking & focused, agile, time management

We are process and output oriented (5-15 / goal for week / broad goal for month / do not disturb section). Don't take on more than you can chew and end up not completing any of the tasks you set for yourself, and don't set your bar low so that you can always achieve your goals. One of our primary roles is to learn how to consistently find our work threshold, so that we can accurately set our own achievable goals, and have those goals at the same time be substantial, without burning out.

##Building and maintaining trust

In any business relationship (or personal for that matter), trust is the single most important "glue".Â Trust is earned by making good on your commitments, or having an understandable and credible reason why you fell short. When we say we will do something, we will do our best to do it.

##Results oriented

When setting (weekly/daily) goals for yourself, aim for it to be something measurable. Like 3 client calls, or 10 issues.

##Team cohesion, unified goal, direct communication

Let's discuss things we disagree on until we agree or compromise. Let those be declared and explicit instead of implied. We will always attempt to reach decisions in a collaborative manner, however senior leadership will need to make decisions periodically when there are multiple dug in opinions. Then, we all row the same way.

##Async (Asynchronous)

We will try not to do things that consume others time if we do not have to. If you have a question to ask, and it is not mission critical, do not interrupt someone for the answer. Send them a note and move on to something else, or answer notes sent to you while you wait on a response. We do not want to interrupt or halt someone else's productivity just so we can get our answer immediately. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. This point is primarily about not distracting others, so they can focus on their work. Relevant example: http://twitpic.com/dj27dh

##Visible, collaborative, accessible

We do want to use apps or internal/external processes that can be accessed, modified, or commented on by all at any time. Managing any sort of process should not be done on an Excel document or an application that cannot be freely accessed by all. This is important to get right so that we can be asynchronous. The best tools right now for this are Trello, the main accord application itself, our team chat application (mattermost), and github.

##Agile, scientific, not over-engineered, sprints, adaptive, mvp

When building something, instead of over engineering, build the dumbest quickest possible solution and set a short deadline for yourself. You will learn vastly more in doing than planning. This does not only apply to software: https://hackernoon.com/an-agile-approach-to-life-7bb2e9ccbc81.

##Documented

We want to have our process approachable to anyone. Not only that, but quickly searchable. If you find yourself asking the same question multiple times, it is a good candidate to be added in the relevant section or to the knowledge base.

##Do not disturb headphones

When someone has their headphones on, leave them alone unless "the building is on fire". If you need to grind, put your headphones on.

##Trello

Use it. Learn it.

##Development issue and feature log

Is this a big problem or a little problem? At any given time, there will be 3 or so years of improvements that need to be made to the system. We should only add something to this list if it comes up consistently and is truly a problem. We should also prioritize our list of items to tackle often. Manage these on github.
