The Accord Process operates on an annual cycle. Each year, employers must deliver 1095-C forms to their employees, postmarked by January 31 and submit all forms \(1095-C and 1094-C\) electronically to the IRS by March 31. The Accord system facilitates ongoing as well as year end data aggregation and provides tools to generate the deliverables required of the employer \(client\) in an efficient manner. On this page is an overview of each of the primary annual tasks with \(eventual\) links to more complete protocol.
