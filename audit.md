Starting in August each year, we will begin a audit process for each Full service and form generation client. The process entails:

1. Review of employer settings to make sure accurate and complete
2. Review possible terms missing (Will)
3. Review of possible duplicates in the system (Ryan)
4. Generate all forms initial form sets and gather breakdown of errors (automation) Review form set alerts to see what major issues are
5. Generate transmissions on all to check for additional errors
6. Send out waivers needed requests
