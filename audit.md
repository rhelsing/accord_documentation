#Audit

Starting in August each year, we will begin a audit process for each Full service and form generation client. The initial pass through should last one month and will give us an idea of what to focus on for the rest of the year leading into print and filing. The process is carried out on the audit Trello board and entails the following:

1. Review of employer settings to make sure accurate and complete
* gather LCMPs  - especially for the ones that have various.
* Review possible terms missing (Will)
* Review of possible duplicates in the system (Ryan)
* Generate all forms initial form sets and gather breakdown of errors (automation) Review form set alerts to see what major issues are
* Generate transmissions on all to check for additional errors
* Send out waivers needed requests


**Potential Items:**
"mid-year audit email" to the client highlighting any areas where they can improve or patting them on the back like a simple red-yellow-green scale of things like Benefit Data Quality, Timeliness of Data, Payroll Data Quality, etc

Check contracts are signed and stored.

also, on the form patrol check automation, i cant remember, but is that fine tuned now to only check for the errors for the months that we have data for (system update)
